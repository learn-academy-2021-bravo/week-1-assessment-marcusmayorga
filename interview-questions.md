# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer: A function is a way to store code to be executed or called on when it's wanted. You'd use one to store and organize actions of code.

  Researched answer: A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. A function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it) for use.



2. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer: console.log() logs something to the console to be seen while return is returning a value to be used by something else in the code but might not be seen by the console.

  Researched answer: console.log() is a function used to print information to the console. 'return' on the other hand is a call to pass some value back up to where the call was made.



3. In regards to functions, what is the difference between an argument and a parameter?

  Your answer: A parameter is like a placeholder for what an argument will be later when the function is called.

  Researched answer: Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition (when it's made). Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked (when it's called).



4. What is a built-in method?

  Your answer: A built-in method is a method (ready made function) included in the javascript language.

  Researched answer: A method is a function which is a property of an object.



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: One person is active with typing the code while the other person is talking concepts and looking for errors.

  Researched answer: The driver handles typing, navigating between files, and basic implementation. The navigator, on the other hand, looks at broader concerns and checks for mistakes.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: The peanut butter and jelly sandwich thing reminded me that every detailed step matters. Funny thing is I first heard of that exercise when I was 10 years old but doing it again was helpful in showing me how steps should be explained in programming.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: A higher order function is a function that takes a function as an argument, or returns a function.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook.

3. Classes: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Properties and methods define what an object should have, which taken together are considered a type, and then instantiate many objects using that blueprint. A class acts as an object creation factory.

4. Constructor: A constructor is a function that creates an instance of a class which is typically called an “object”. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when you declare an object using the new keyword. 

5. React: React is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.
